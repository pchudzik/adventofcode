# Learning with adventofcode.com

Implementation of exercises from [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com).

I've _started learning python_ and those are implementations to get myself faimiliar with language syntax.

# To run tests:

```
pipenv install
make test
```

# To run single exercise

```
make -C year XX-exercise.py
```

for example:

```
make -C 2015 run-03
```
